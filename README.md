## 🧩 Projects: Code in Action

### 🌌 EXO Project
```python
from tailscale import SecureNetwork

class EXOProject:
    def __init__(self):
        self.security = SecureNetwork()
        self.goal = "Simplify remote backend connections while ensuring ironclad security."

    def deploy(self):
        print("Building secure, scalable systems that connect seamlessly!")
```

### 🖼️ Image Captioning System
```python
# Developed a Siamese-GCN architecture with KAF and LSTM-attention for image captioning
from deep_learning import SiameseGCN, LSTMAttention

class ImageCaptioning:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = SiameseGCN()
        self.attention = LSTMAttention()

    def caption(self, image):
        return self.model.generate_caption(image, attention=self.attention)
```
